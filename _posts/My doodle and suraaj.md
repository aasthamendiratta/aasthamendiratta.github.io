Doodle's smile is always the first thing I see in the morning, and his wagging tail is the last thing I see at night. I love doodle more than Suraaj.

He is scared of balloons and sleeps on my bed without my permission now. Feels like I am living in his home. For the same reason I have decided to go on a trip with Suraaj to see how it feels to live with another dog who doesn't obey me.
